# Supervised Classification for Underserved Regions

## Overview

This Jupyter Notebook explores supervised classification techniques to identify and analyze underserved regions in the context of Medicare Durable Medical Equipment (DME) data. The analysis aims to uncover inefficiencies, optimize resource allocation, and inform targeted policy interventions.

## Objectives

1. Classify underserved regions based on supplier charges and service volumes.
2. Identify temporal and regional disparities in service distribution.

## Key Features

- **Supervised Models**:

  - Classification: Logistic Regression, Random Forest

- **Evaluation Metrics**:

  - Classification: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC, MCC,Â Brier Score

- **Time Series Analysis**:

  - Investigating temporal trends in supplier charges and Medicare payments.

## Tools and Libraries

- Python 3.9.13
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Notebook Environment: Jupyter (IPython Kernel)

## How to Use

1. **Set Up**:

   - Ensure the required libraries are installed.
   - Load the dataset provided in the `data` directory.

2. **Run the Notebook**:

   - Execute all cells sequentially for a complete analysis pipeline.

3. **Outputs**:

   - Visualizations of trends and relationships.
   - Classification performance metrics.
   - Insights into underserved regions and temporal patterns.

## Results

The analysis highlights:

- Regions with high supplier charges but low service volumes.
- Temporal trends indicating inefficiencies or potential fraud.
- Model-driven insights to guide policy improvements.
